1: Fix cost function: 
    - One elevator often does all the work
    - 3 elevators funky af. One does all the work, assignments get a little weird and things drive out of bounds

2: Acknowledgements
    - Blocking of orders: Only one speaks at a time
    - Make sure every elevator always has the same list

3: Error-handling:
    - Acknowledgements?
    - Try/catch initializatoins.
    - Restarts when timeout
    - Notice timeouts
    - If an elevator dies, re-assign it's orders

4: Document code/README! *BEFORE DELIVERY*
